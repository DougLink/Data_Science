# Douglas Link
<sub>*Data Scientist*</sub>

As a professional I combine analytical skills and attention to detail. Working for several years as an Administrator I was able to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This set of skills influenced me on pursuing Data Science when I decided on a career change.

I am currently studying Computing Technologies at Solent University (UK) and Data Science at Sigmoidal (BR).

**Background in:** Python.
